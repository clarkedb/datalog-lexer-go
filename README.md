# Datalog Lexical Scanner (Go)

A lexical scanner that reads a sequence of characters from a text file, identifies the Datalog language tokens found in the file, and outputs each token.

Examples of input/output and a table of valid tokens can be found [here](https://faculty.cs.byu.edu/~barker/cs236/labs/lab1-extra.html).

More information about Datalog can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog).
